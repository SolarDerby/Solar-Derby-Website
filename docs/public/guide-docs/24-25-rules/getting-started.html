    In order to begin building your Solar Derby car you will need to first 3d print or purchase all of the parts from the parts list.
    Once you have assembled all of the needed items it is best to start by building the chassis, steering system and drive train.
    Assemble the steering units and drive train and mount them to the chassis.
    At this point you could mount the motor, esc and reciever. 
    Connect the servo to the the channel 2 port on the reciever (see photo for wire orientation)
    Connect the esc to the channel 1 port on the reciever (see photo for wire orientation)
    At this point you can test to radio and reciever to make sure that the radio is bound. Plug in a battery to the the connector on the ESC (check photo for wire orientation and connector type)
